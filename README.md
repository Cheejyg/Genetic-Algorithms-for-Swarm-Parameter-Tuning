# Genetic Algorithms for Swarm Parameter Tuning
Swarming behaviour is based on aggregation of simple drones exhibiting basic instinctive reactions to stimuli. However, to achieve overall balanced/interesting behaviour the relative importance of these instincts, as well their internal parameters, must be tuned. In this project, you will learn how to apply Genetic Programming as means of such tuning, and attempt to achieve a series of non-trivial swarm-level behaviours.
